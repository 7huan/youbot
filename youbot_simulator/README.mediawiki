''' youbot_simulator '''

This package combines differet packages that allow to simulate navigation and manipulation with youbot.

=== Dependancies ===
* '''navigation''' via apt-get or git: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/indigo-devel
* '''youbot_navigation''' configuration package: https://github.com/youbot/youbot_navigation
* '''youbot_description''': https://github.com/youbot/youbot_description
* '''youbot_moveit_config''': just have something if needed, [https://github.com/svenschneider/youbot-manipulation/tree/indigo/youbot_moveit this] is also an option
* '''fake_odom_publiher''': https://github.com/ut-ims-robotics/fake_odom_publisher

=== Preparations ===
Since there is no LIDAR or RBG-D cam simulation, there is no localization. TF (map -> odom) is statically published, therefore odometry data is "perfectly accurate", its a sim.

But move_base has to know, that it should not be expecting LIDAR, RBGD-D, etc., data. for that open ''' youbot_navigation/youbot_navigation_common/config/costmap_common_params.yaml''' file and remove or override this line: 
 observation_sources: base_scan

=== Usage ===
==== Navigation simulation (no MoveIt!) ====
* Launch with default settings:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator navigation.launch

* Use a different URDF source:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator

==== Full simulation (navigation + MoveIt!) ====
* Launch with default settings:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator full_simulation.launch

 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator
 
==== Maps ====
Different maps can be used for navigation,
