''' youbot_simulator '''

This package combines different packages that allow simulating navigation and manipulation with youbot.

''' TESTED and DEVELOPED ON INDIGO '''. Kinetic has brought in '''eval''' tags which make argument evaluation way more dynamic.
----
=== Default dependancies ===
* '''navigation''' via apt-get or git: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/indigo-devel
* '''youbot_navigation''' configuration package: https://github.com/youbot/youbot_navigation
* '''youbot_description''': https://github.com/youbot/youbot_description
* '''youbot_moveit_config''': just have something if needed, [https://github.com/svenschneider/youbot-manipulation/tree/indigo/youbot_moveit this] is also an option
* '''fake_odom_publiher''': https://github.com/ut-ims-robotics/fake_odom_publisher

=== Preparations ===
Since there is no LIDAR or RBG-D cam simulation, there is no localization. TF (map -> odom) is statically published, therefore odometry data (published by fake_odom_publisher node) is "perfectly accurate", its a sim.

But move_base has to know, that it should not be expecting LIDAR, RBGD-D, etc., data. In order to do so, open ''' youbot_navigation/youbot_navigation_common/config/costmap_common_params.yaml''' file and remove or override this line: 
 observation_sources: base_scan

=== Usage ===
==== Navigation simulation (no MoveIt!) ====
* Launch with default settings:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator navigation.launch

* Use a different URDF package:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator navigation.launch robot_description_package:="$(find OTHER_URDF_PACKAGE)"

==== Full simulation (navigation + MoveIt!) ====
* Launch with default settings:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator full_simulation.launch

* Use a different MoveIt! config package
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator full_simulation.launch moveit_config_package:="$(find OTHER_MOVEIT_PACKAGE)"

==== Maps ====
Different maps can be used when launching arbitrary launch files, just put the .pgm and .yaml file into the "map" folder:
 $ roslaunch youbot_simulator FILL_IN_THE_BLANKS.launch map:="OTHER_MAP.yaml"
